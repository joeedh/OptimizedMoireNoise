1.2 x*y*seed

fract(X*y*seed) produces a very structured pattern.  It's structural ID function can be
computed analyticaly, but has severe (severe!)  numberical precision issues. The ID filter
reduced to a simple polynomial; just running the filter naively resulted in a very noisy
result, which wasn't in the simplified polynomial.
